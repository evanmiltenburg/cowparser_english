# cowparser_english
This repository contains a python script for the COW corpus data made available at webcorpora.org. This corpus was created by Felix Bildhauer and Roland Schäfer. A full description of the work behind this data can be found at corporafromtheweb.org.

If you are looking for a parser for the Dutch data, see [here](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/cowparser_dutch). For some reason, the Dutch data has a different format from the English one. This script should work for everything annotated in the minimal XML VRT format (e.g. DECOW14, ENCOW14).
